The Chinese font for the legends is meant to be rendered in Noto Sans SC, a Google Font available for download free here:

In the KLE mockups, the custom style code renders the font using the Medium 500 style, but this is left to the discretion of the renderer and production designers to complement the weight of the GMK stock legend font, if not to match it exactly, given that Chinese character stroke weight should generally be lighter than Latin character stroke weight.
